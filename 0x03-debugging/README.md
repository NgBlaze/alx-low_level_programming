0x03. C - Debugging

0-main.c, main.h - In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

1-main.c -  Like, comment, subscribe
mandatory

2-largest_number.c, main.h - This program prints the largest of three integers.
